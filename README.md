Water Jam

Achilles is a game written in 48 hours as an entry for the 2014 [CivicHacks](http://civichacks.org) Game Jam.

The goal was to raise awareness of the global water crisis and ultimately promote [PackH2O](http://www.packh2o.com/), a Columbus-based startup that designs water backpacks for developing water-stressed regions.
